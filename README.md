# homeassistant-whirlpool-oven

Home Assistant custom component for interfacing with Whirlpool/Maytag/KitchenAid ovens.

Home Assistant already supports air conditioners, washing machines, and dryers from these manufacturers through the `whirlpool` integration.
This custom integration only provides additional support for ovens (ranges, stoves) from the same manufacturers.

I've created this as a custom integration because updating the built-in `whirlpool` integration would have been messy. The current code does not easily extend to accomodate mutiple appliance types, or multiple entity types for those appliances. One of the goals of this integration is provide an extensible foundation for all Whirlpool appliances. It will start with ovens, but in time, the other appliance types could be re-integrated as well.

# Installation via HACS
